Basic Science Quiz
=======

This app is a basic science quiz built mostly to practice jQuery, JavaScript, Git, HTML, & CSS, and partially to increase visibility of science.

## Getting Started

The actual quiz is available here: https://omaiyea.github.io/quiz-app/

## Future Enhancements

* The concepts the user is quizzed on are really basic since the target audience is broad... Could present questions progressively harder. 
* Read questions and answers from a file for easier maintenance. 
* Automated testing, including for regressions.
